<li>Never use underscores or other characters</li>
<li>No capital letters</li>

<li>Google search result Page</li>
<li>Facebook, comments threads, or any other website where someone might post a link to your page</li>

<h1>4. Body</h1>

<li>Put your information in priority order with the most important information first.</li>
<li>Use short words, sentences, and paragraphs.</li>
<li>Think about your user first. What is the information that they want to know?</li>
<li>Are you using language that your users understand?</li>
<li>Never use all caps unless it's a predefined style you cannot control. Use bold instead if you're wanting to convey emphasis.</li>

<h1>5.Headings</h1>

<li>Visitors usually only see the first 2 words for each list item, so make those first 2 words meaningful.</li>

<h1>7. Bold, Italics, and Underline</h1>
<h3>On the web, bold, italics, and underline each have a unique purpose.</h3>
<h2>Bold</h2>
<h3>Use bold for highlighting important info, such as an application deadline or fee. You can also use bold for key introductory phrases of bulleted lists.
Words of advice: if bold is overused, it’s no longer helpful. When too much is emphasized nothing stands out.</h3>
<h2>Italics</h2>
<h3>Uses italics according to the Bethel Style Guide:</h3>
<li>Book Titles</li>
<li>Movie Titles</li>
<Li>Titles of Newspapers or publications</Li>
<li>Other items as noted in the style guide</li>
<h2>Underline</h2>
<li>Never underline text on the web. Visitors will mistake underlined text for a link. This leads to confusion and reduces the impact of what you were trying to highlight. Use bold for emphasis instead.</li>

<h1>8.Links</h1>
<h3>Hyperlink meaningful phrases rather than single words or words that lack context.</h3>
<li>Phrases are easier to spot.</li>
<li>Meaningful words help search engines scan and pick up useful information.</li>
<li>Avoid using "here" and "click here."</li>
<h4>Alert visitors when links will lead them to a document instead of a webpage by adding the appropriate tag at the end of the link:</h4>
<li>Bethel Undergraduate Catalog (pdf)</li>
<li>Bethel Style Guide (doc)</li>
<li>Bethel Expense Report (xls)</li>

<h1>9. Call to Action</h1>
<h3>Nearly all webpages should provide visitors with a call to action. What do we want them to do with this information? What task have they come to perform?</h3>
<h3>It’s helpful to always give visitors a place to go from each webpage that’s related to the task at hand.</h3>
